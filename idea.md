## Description
Learnr is an online platform for for sharing knowledge and having a social community of users with similar interests. The platform has three main purposes: to allow users to create their own classes, to allow users to discover new and interesting courses, and to provide methods of communication to users about the classes they instructor or are enrolled in. Courses are not limited in any way, and can range from academic topics to arts and crafts.

## How It Works
All users sign up on the site and provide authentication information (either a password or Facebook login). Users can then interact with the community by enrolling in classes and by creating their own classes. When a user has enrolled in a class, he will receive notifications when changes are made to the course. Moreover, as a user enrols in classes, Learnr will provide recommendations for other classes that might be of interest, as well as other users who share similar interests/classes. Users can also interact with each other through a messaging system.

## Challenges
Often students in academic classes use a few sites to navigate the information provided (a course website, Piazza for questions, and Facebook groups to communicate with classmates). Learnr aims to bring these aspects closer together by integrating them into one website. Further, by not being limited to academic courses, Learnr allows for smaller classes to benefit from the same resources a larger class would.

Users who wish to enrol in a course may not always know what to enrol in or which course out of a group would be the best. Learnr's recommendation and rating system helps make both decisions easier. Users who wish to teach a class also have access to valuable review and rating information to help them improve their classes.
